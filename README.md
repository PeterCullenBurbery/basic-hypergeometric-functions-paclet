# hypergeometric-functions-paclet
 This is a paclet for hypergeometric functions.
 I am working on writing good code.
 I hope to do this by using version control to store history with GitHub instead of just copying the file to a backup directory on my computer. I am using GitHub and GitHub Desktop.
 I am using Mathematica 13.3 Prerelease version to build the paclet.
 I am still learning how to create paclets.
 I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to automatically load all functions. For more details, see https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2930977.
 I am using Mathematica and the Wolfram Language to build this paclet.
 In the future, I might submit this paclet to the Paclet Repository at paclets.com.
 I'm not using Git because I don't understand how to use it.
 I currently have a bug that I am trying to work out.
 I found this debugging blog post article at freecodecamp.org helpful: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-debugging-how-to-debug-code
 There are some details about my bug at https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2929795?p_p_auth=Lp5Wq3WS.
 For more information, see the Wikipedia article for the Q Pochhammer symbol at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Pochhammer_symbol, and the Wikipedia article for the Generalized hypergeometric function at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_hypergeometric_function.
 I would like to take the input a b c d q^(-1+n) and move q to the front to get q^(-1+n) a b c d and then convert the math expression to LaTeX with q^{n-1}abcd.
